You have access to data from UN Comtrade on exports from Ukraine for 2023. The overall amount of Comtrade data is huge and you need special access to the API so we've provied you with a file-based version of the data.

The file is called `data/Ukraine_Exports_Comtrade_2023.csv`. This data contains exports from Ukraine for 2023 by HS code and country of destination. The `cmdCode` column contains the HS code and the `partnerCode` column contains the country code. The `partnerISO` column contains the ISO code for the country of destination. `qty` and `qtyUnitAbbr` can be used to understand the quantity of the export and the abbreviation for the unit of measure (e.g. 'kg').

You also have access to a refernce file called `data/HS_Commodity_Codes.csv` which you can use to look up commodity codes and descriptions if you find that helpful.
