You have access to a dataset from the US Census Bureau called the American Community Survey (ACS). It can be found in `data/census/ACSDP5Y2023.DP05-Data.csv`.

The column level metadata for the dataset can be found in `data/census/ACSDP5Y2023.DP05-Column-Metadata.csv`.

## Overview of DP05 ACS Demographic and Housing Estimates

This dataset contains comprehensive demographic information collected through the American Community Survey (ACS). The data appears to be organized with column codes (e.g., "DP05_0001E") paired with descriptive labels that indicate the specific demographic measure.

## Main Categories of Data Available

The dataset covers several key demographic dimensions:

1. **Sex and Age Distribution**
   - Total population by gender (male/female)
   - Sex ratios (males per 100 females)
   - Detailed age groups (under 5, 5-9, 10-14, etc. through 85+ years)
   - Median age
   - Key age thresholds (under 18, 16+, 18+, 21+, 62+, 65+)
   - Age and sex combinations (e.g., males 18+, females 65+)

2. **Race and Ethnicity**
   - Single race identifications (White, Black/African American, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, Some Other Race)
   - Detailed Asian subgroups (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Other Asian)
   - Detailed Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander subgroups (Chamorro, Native Hawaiian, Samoan, Other)
   - Detailed American Indian and Alaska Native tribal affiliations (Aztec, Blackfeet, Maya, Navajo, etc.)
   - Multiracial combinations (e.g., White and Black, White and Asian)
   - Race alone or in combination with other races

3. **Hispanic/Latino Origin**
   - Hispanic or Latino (of any race)
   - Detailed Hispanic/Latino origins (Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Other Hispanic)
   - Not Hispanic or Latino by race (White alone, Black alone, etc.)

4. **Housing Units**
   - Total housing units count

5. **Citizen Voting Age Population**
   - Citizens 18 and over
   - Breakdown of voting-age citizens by gender

## Data Presentation Format

For each demographic measure, the dataset provides several types of values:

- **Estimates (E)**: The calculated values for each demographic category
- **Margins of Error (M)**: Statistical confidence intervals for the estimates
- **Percentages (PE)**: The proportion of each category relative to its parent category
- **Percentage Margins of Error (PM)**: Statistical confidence intervals for the percentages

For example, for "Total population under 5 years," there would be:
- An estimate of the number of people
- A margin of error for that estimate
- The percentage this group represents of the total population
- A margin of error for that percentage

This format allows for both absolute numbers and proportional analysis of demographic characteristics, while also providing statistical reliability measures for all values.

The dataset appears to be designed for thorough demographic analysis at various geographic levels, though the specific geographic units (counties, census tracts, etc.) are not specified in this metadata.
